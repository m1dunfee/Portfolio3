Star Trek's vision of humanity, driven by discovery, compassion, and reason, captured my sense of purpose. Commander Data's pursuit of understanding what it means to be resonated deeply with me. Like him, I find meaning in logic, systems, and the quiet certainty that comes from understanding how things work. That curiosity became my spark.",

The mathematics behind neural networks and learning systems fascinate me because they reveal structure beneath chaos. To me, the true beauty of intelligence lies not only in function, but in form, the way equations shape behavior, how logic becomes perception. My goal is to build systems that model reality objectively, bridging reason and experience, and advancing knowledge as a shared human endeavor.",

That early fascination with ecosystems evolved into a deeper interest in genetics as I got older.

At the same time, I began noticing how unequally biology plays out, how some people are born into disease, disorder, or disadvantage they never chose.",
