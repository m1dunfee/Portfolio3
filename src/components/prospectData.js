      "I love Star Trek. Its premise reflects my deepest hopes for humanity—growth through exploration, cooperation, and technology. One of my favorite characters is Commander Data. His journey to understand reality and what it means to be human resonates deeply with me. As a scientist, I take comfort in facts and logic, and I see beauty in systems that model the world through reason.",

      "I believe artificial intelligence has the potential to assist humanity in profound ways—especially when grounded in objectivity and statistical insight. I’m passionate about building AI that supports human goals with increasing autonomy and clarity, guided by ethical principles and practical design. What excites me most is not just the functionality of these systems, but the mathematics that define their behavior—the logic behind neural networks, decision trees, and optimization. They say math is the language of the universe, and I believe it. Even with our biological limits, the numbers don’t lie. They speak to something deeper, something stable.",
      
      "To me, building AI isn’t just about automation—it’s about learning to see the world more clearly through an objective lens, and using that insight to create systems that reflect our best potential."

  title: 'Bioinfomatics',
  paragraph: [
    "Biology was my first love in science. As a Boy Scout, I was introduced to ecology and the responsibility we have to preserve and protect life. That early fascination with ecosystems evolved into a deeper interest in genetics as I got older. Superheroes always seemed too far-fetched—but the idea of rewriting the building blocks of life to solve real problems felt within reach. At the same time, I began noticing how unequally biology plays out—how some people are born into disease, disorder, or disadvantage they never chose.",

    "That sense of imbalance is what drives my interest in CRISPR and genetic engineering. I want to work on technologies that level the playing field—whether that means reducing genetic predispositions to disease or using native plants to detoxify environments damaged by industry. From editing a gene to help a child avoid a rare illness to modifying plants that absorb nickel from contaminated mining zones, I’m inspired by the possibility of recoding life for good.",
    
    "My foundation in computer science gives me the tools to model biological systems, while my passion for fairness and sustainability gives me the reason. Bioinformatics and gene editing are where I see those values meet—and where I hope to make my mark."

  title: 'Cyber Security',
  paragraph: [
    "Cybersecurity doesn’t call to me in quite the same way as other areas of computer science—but I’ve come to realize I have a natural knack for it. Concepts like SQL injections, least privilege, and secure communication protocols tend to stick with me without effort. I don’t go out of my way to memorize them—they just stay top of mind.",

    "Maybe it’s because I’ve always enjoyed daydreaming about how systems can be broken—especially in games. That same mindset naturally extends to questions like: How could I scan ports on a network? Could a buffer overflow in an isolated system reveal something unexpected? I’ve explored tools like Wireshark out of sheer curiosity, and found myself fascinated by the depth of visibility they offer into network behavior.",
    
    "Organizations like OWASP and CISA spark further interest by documenting known exploits, which give me scenarios to reverse-engineer or mentally model. Even if I didn’t plan to go into cybersecurity at first, it’s a space where my instincts and habits line up well with real-world needs—and I wouldn’t be surprised if I end up there."

  paragraph: [
    "I’ve loved games ever since I first picked up Morrowind—I must’ve been around eight. Over the years, gaming became more than a pastime; it became a way of seeing systems, logic, and interaction unfold in real time. As I began learning web development, I started craving something deeper: full system design, dynamic interactions, and object behaviors that go beyond static interfaces.",

    "One of my favorite subjects in college was physics. Even though it was challenging, I found the logic behind motion, collisions, and forces fascinating—and I can’t help but imagine how powerful it would be to program that logic into a virtual world. I believe games are reflections of our own reality, just shaped through the lens of rules and imagination. It’s one thing to play them—but building them feels like an act of learning, translating real-world thought into simulated systems.",
    
    "I’ve also worked in game testing, and I never tired of it. I’d spend all day testing, then come home and voluntarily boot up the same game. I guess I’m a creature of habit—but now, I’d like to start designing entirely new creatures of my own."
