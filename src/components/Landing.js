                    I'm Matthew Dunfee — a computer scientist with a foundation built through hands-on industry experience and a vision aimed toward AI, systems design, and problem-solving at scale.

                    In the past, I’ve worn a lot of hats: game tester, Java developer, MERN consultant, full-stack bootcamp instructor. Each role sharpened a different edge — from catching bugs at Activision to supporting Enterprise software, to mentoring students as they launched their first solo projects. I’ve worked across the stack and across environments — Oracle, Node, React, Pick Basic, Spring Boot — always focused on learning the systems beneath the syntax.

                    Today, I’m nearing completion of my B.S. in Computer Science with a 3.7 GPA, while continuing to grow as a developer. I value clean architecture, strategic debugging, and the ability to move between abstraction and implementation. I see programming as both an art and a craft — one that requires discipline, curiosity, and clarity of thought.

                    Looking ahead, I’m working toward building systems that combine IoT and AI — tools that aren’t just responsive, but adaptive. I’m especially interested in the ethical and structural design of software: how we build systems that respect autonomy, privacy, and purpose. My current projects reflect that ambition.
