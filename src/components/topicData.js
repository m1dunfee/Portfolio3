      "'Have you ever heard someone say programming is like building with Legos? It’s a fun comparison—but in truth, programming goes far beyond snapping blocks together. You can’t use Legos to analyze genetic data or record real-time environmental changes. Yet, on a syntactic level, programming has recurring structures—common building blocks—that guide the flow of logic. These structures scale into design patterns: reusable solutions to frequent problems that occur across different software domains.",

      "What makes design patterns powerful is that they transcend specific programming languages. They're not just about syntax—they operate on a meta-layer, helping answer how a developer might implement user stories in a way that aligns with project needs. This is crucial, because code isn’t truly functional unless it meets user expectations. Design patterns help bridge that gap between \"what the user needs\" and \"how the system delivers it.\" In that sense, they become not only technical solutions but also tools for collaboration, communication, and clarity."

    'The classical philosopher Plato was skeptical of overspecialization in education. He feared students’ wisdom would suffer as the education system failed to span the elucidation space of knowledge. If you spend all your time in one area, how can you navigate and correlate that information across different disciplines?',

    'This is a valid point—omniscience impossible for any human. Knowledge is too vast and time too finite. However, we do not need to know every curve of King Hieron II crown to find out how much gold is in it. We could spend our entire lives trying to rebuild the ‘wheels’ that turn society just to understand our current position.',

    'Abstraction is the key to navigating complex systems. Today we face an ever-accelerating pace of life—from societal obligations to rapid technological advancements, and even the eventual heat death of the universe. We don’t have the luxury time to reinvent the wheel.',

    'Sir Isaac Newton was right when he said, “we stand on the shoulders of giants.” By abstracting the work of those who came before us, we can scale our productivity to overcome the distortions of time’s entropy and adapt to changing circumstances.',

    'On that note, LLMs and ML are important tools in the school of abstraction. They use mathematical principles to uncover relationships in data and detect common patterns. A trait often deemed utterly human ‘pattern seeking behavior’ so it’s only natural that we use AI to replicate and extend our own capabilities.',
