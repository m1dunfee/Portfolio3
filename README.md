Thanks for visiting! this app has been really fun to make. It reminded me of the time I spend at Prime Digital Academy getting a certificate in fullstack software engineering. We used react in the mern stack and while this is just a front end, it was remenent of my time there.

while this project displays some of my favorite projects, it is only a snapshot. If want to see more please feel free to explore my github account or find my contact info on the footer of www.multiversal.space
