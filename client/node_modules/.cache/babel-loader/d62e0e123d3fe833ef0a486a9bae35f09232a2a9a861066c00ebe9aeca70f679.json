He feared students’ wisdom would suffer as the education system failed to span the elucidation space of knowledge. If you spend all your time in one area, how can you navigate and correlate that information across different disciplines?\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p>\r\n                                    This is a valid point—omniscience impossible for any human. Knowledge is too vast and time too finite. However, we do not need to know every curve of King Hieron II crown to find out how much gold is in it. We could spend our entire lives trying to rebuild the ‘wheels’ that turn society just to understand our current position. \r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p>\r\n                                    Abstraction is the key to navigating complex systems.
